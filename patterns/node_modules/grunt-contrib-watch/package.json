  "readme": "# grunt-contrib-watch [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch)\n\n> Run predefined tasks whenever watched file patterns are added, changed or deleted.\n\n\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-contrib-watch --save-dev\n```\n\nOne the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Watch task\n_Run this task with the `grunt watch` command._\n\n\n### Settings\n\nThere are a number of options available. Please review the [minimatch options here](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#options). As well as some additional options as follows:\n\n#### files\nType: `String|Array`\n\nThis defines what file patterns this task will watch. Can be a string or an array of files and/or minimatch patterns.\n\n#### tasks\nType: `String|Array`\n\nThis defines which tasks to run when a watched file event occurs.\n\n#### options.interrupt\nType: `boolean`\nDefault: false\n\nAs files are modified this watch task will spawn tasks in child processes. The default behavior will only spawn a new child process per target when the previous process has finished. Set the `interrupt` option to true to terminate the previous process and spawn a new one upon later changes.\n\nExample:\n```js\nwatch: {\n  scripts: {\n    files: '**/*.js',\n    tasks: ['jshint'],\n    options: {\n      interrupt: true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### options.debounceDelay\nType: `Integer`\nDefault: 500\n\nHow long to wait before emitting events in succession for the same filepath and status. For example if your `Gruntfile.js` file was `changed`, a `changed` event will only fire again after the given milliseconds.\n\nExample:\n```js\nwatch: {\n  scripts: {\n    files: '**/*.js',\n    tasks: ['jshint'],\n    options: {\n      debounceDelay: 250\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### options.interval\nType: `Integer`\nDefault: 100\n\nThe `interval` is passed to `fs.watchFile`. Since `interval` is only used by `fs.watchFile` and this watcher also uses `fs.watch`; it is recommended to ignore this option. *Default is 100ms*.\n\n### Examples\n\n```js\n// Simple config to run jshint any time a file is added, changed or deleted\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  watch: {\n    files: '**/*',\n    tasks: ['jshint']\n  }\n});\n```\n\n```js\n// Advanced config. Run specific tasks when specific files are added, changed or deleted.\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  watch: {\n    gruntfile: {\n      files: 'Gruntfile.js',\n      tasks: ['jshint:gruntfile'],\n      options: {\n        nocase: true\n      }\n    },\n    src: {\n      files: ['lib/*.js', 'css/**/*.scss', '!lib/dontwatch.js'],\n      tasks: ['default']\n    },\n    test: {\n      files: '<%= jshint.test.src %>',\n      tasks: ['jshint:test', 'qunit']\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### How do I fix the error `EMFILE: Too many opened files.`?\nThis is because of your system's max opened file limit. For OSX the default is very low (256). Temporarily increase your limit with `ulimit -n 10480`, the number being the new max limit.\n\n#### Can I use this with Grunt v0.3?\nYes. Although `grunt-contrib-watch` is a replacement watch task for Grunt v0.4, version `grunt-contrib-watch@0.1.x` is compatible with Grunt v0.3. `grunt-contrib-watch >= 0.2.x` is **only* compatible and recommended to use with Grunt v0.4.\n\n#### Why is the watch devouring all my memory?\nLikely because of an enthusiastic pattern trying to watch thousands of files. Such as `'**/*.js'` but forgetting to exclude the `node_modules` folder with `'!node_modules/**/*.js'`. Try grouping your files within a subfolder or be more explicit with your file matching pattern.\n\n\n## Release History\n\n * 2013-02-14   v0.2.0   First official release for Grunt 0.4.0.\n * 2013-01-17   v0.2.0rc7   Updating grunt/gruntplugin dependencies to rc6.
