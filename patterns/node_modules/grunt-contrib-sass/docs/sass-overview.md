This task requires you to have [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/download.html). If you're on OS X or Linux you probably already have Ruby installed, try `ruby -v` in your terminal. When you've confirmed you have Ruby installed, run `gem install sass` to install Sass.
