  "readme": "JSHint, A Static Code Analysis Tool for JavaScript\n==================================================\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jshint/jshint.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jshint/jshint)\n\nJSHint is a community-driven tool to detect errors and potential problems in\nJavaScript code and to enforce your team's coding conventions. We made JSHint\nvery flexible so you can easily adjust it to your particular coding guidelines\nand the environment you expect your code to execute in.\n\nOur goal is to help JavaScript developers write complex programs without\nworrying about typos and language gotchas.\n\nWe believe that static code analysis programs—as well as other code quality\ntools—are important and beneficial to the JavaScript community and, thus,\nshould not alienate their users.\n\nFor general usage and hacking information, visit our website:\n[http://jshint.com/](http://jshint.com/).\n\nJSHint Fundraiser / Bug Bounties\n--------------------------------\n\nWe're [running a fundraiser](https://www.bountysource.com/#fundraisers/91-jshint)\nfor JSHint! If JSHint helps you in your day-to-day development, please consider\ndonating.  All money raised on this page will be used as monetary rewards for\nfixing JSHint bugs and implementing new features. Our hope is to introduce more\ndevelopers to JSHint hacking and boost its development.\n\n**Rules**:\n\n1. All funds (aside from fees) will be used only to fund bounties.\n2. If core team ends up fixing bounty bugs, the reward will be donated to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n3. Before marking bugs as fixed, all patches must be reviewed by a core team member.\n\nThanks!\n\nReporting a bug\n---------------\n\nTo report a bug simply create a\n[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/new) and describe\nyour problem or suggestion. We welcome all kind of feedback regarding\nJSHint including but not limited to:\n\n * When JSHint doesn't work as expected\n * When JSHint complains about valid JavaScript code that works in all browsers\n * When you simply want a new option or feature\n\nBefore reporting a bug look around to see if there are any open or closed tickets\nthat cover your issue. And remember the wisdom: pull request > bug report > tweet.\n\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n#### How do I turn off \"mixed tabs and spaces\" warning?\n\nIf you're using so-called [smart tabs](http://www.emacswiki.org/SmartTabs)\nthen we have an option `smarttabs` for you. Otherwise, your solution is to\nrun JSHint with a custom reporter that discards any warnings you don't like.\nFor example, this [example reporter](https://gist.github.com/3885619)\ndiscards all warnings about mixed tabs and spaces.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nLook for a file named `CONTRIBUTING.md` in this repository. It contains our\ncontributing guidelines. We also have\n[a mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/jshint/).\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nJSHint is distributed under the MIT License.
