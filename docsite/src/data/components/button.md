Buttons communicate actions that users can take. They are typically placed throughout your UI, in places like:

- Dialogs
- Modal windows
- Forms
- Cards
- Toolbars

Buttons are just one option for representing actions in a product and shouldn’t be overused. Too many buttons on a screen disrupts the visual hierarchy.

## Default

Default button styling.

<code-preview group="default"></code-preview>

## Elevated

Elevated buttons are essentially filled tonal buttons with a shadow. To prevent shadow creep, only use them when absolutely necessary, such as when the button requires visual separation from a patterned background.

## Filled

Filled buttons have the most visual impact after the FAB, and should be used for important, final actions that complete a flow, like Save, Join now, or Confirm.

## Filled tonal

A filled tonal button is an alternative middle ground between filled and outlined buttons. They’re useful in contexts where a lower-priority button requires slightly more emphasis than an outline would give, such as "Next" in an onboarding flow. Tonal buttons use the secondary color mapping.

## Outlined

Outlined buttons are medium-emphasis buttons. They contain actions that are important, but aren’t the primary action in an app.

Outlined buttons pair well with filled buttons to indicate an alternative, secondary action.

## Text

Text buttons are used for the lowest priority actions, especially when presenting multiple options.

Text buttons can be placed on a variety of backgrounds. Until the button is interacted with, its container isn’t visible.
