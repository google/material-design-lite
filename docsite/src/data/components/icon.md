Icons visually communicate the button’s action. Their meaning should be clear and unambiguous. Icon buttons can be grouped **together** or they can **stand alone**.

- Icon buttons can take the form of a wide range of system icons.
- Ensure the meaning of the icon is unambiguous.
- On hover, include a tooltip that describes the button’s action, rather than the name of the icon itself.
- Use the outline-style icons to indicate an unselected state and a filled style to indicate selection.

## Default

<code-preview group="default"></code-preview>

## Selected

<code-preview group="selected"></code-preview>

## Toggle

<code-preview group="toggle"></code-preview>
<code-preview group="toggle-input"></code-preview>

## Contained

Use a contained icon button when the component requires more visual separation from the background.

Contained icon buttons can have one of three styles:

- Filled
- Filled tonal
- Outlined

### Filled

Filled icon buttons have higher visual impact and are best for high emphasis actions.

<code-preview group="contained.filled"></code-preview>

### Filled tonal

Filled tonal icon buttons are a middle ground between filled and outlined icon buttons. They’re useful in contexts where the button requires slightly more emphasis than an outline would give, such as a secondary action paired with a high emphasis action.

<code-preview group="contained.filled-tonal"></code-preview>

### Outlined

Outlined icon buttons are medium-emphasis buttons. They’re useful when an icon button needs more emphasis than a standard icon button but less than a filled or filled tonal icon button.

<code-preview group="contained.outlined"></code-preview>
