##Introduction
The Material Design Lite (MDL) **card** component is a user interface element representing a virtual piece of paper that contains related data &mdash; such as a photo, some text, and a link &mdash; that are all about a single subject.

Cards are a convenient means of coherently displaying related content that is composed of different types of objects. They are also well-suited for presenting similar objects whose size or supported actions can vary considerably, like photos with captions of variable length. Cards have a constant width and a variable height, depending on their content.

Cards are a fairly new feature in user interfaces, and allow users an access point to more complex and detailed information. Their design and use is an important factor in the overall user experience. See the card component's [Material Design specifications page](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/cards.html) for details.

##Basic use
To use any MDL component, you must include the minified CSS and JavaScript files using standard relative-path references in the `<head>` section of the page, as described in the MDL Introduction.

###To include an MDL **card** component:

&nbsp;1. Code a `<div>` element; this is the "outer" container, intended to hold all of the card's content.
```html
<div>
</div>
```
&nbsp;2. Inside the div, code one or more "inner" divs, one for each desired content block. A card containing a title, an image, some text, and an action bar would contain four "inner" divs, all siblings.
```html
<div>
  <div>
  ...
  </div>
  <div>
  ...
  </div>
  <div>
  ...
  </div>
  <div>
  ...
  </div>
</div>
```
&nbsp;3. Add one or more MDL classes, separated by spaces, to the "outer" div and the "inner" divs (depending on their intended use) using the `class` attribute.
```html
<div class="mdl-card">
  <div class="mdl-card__title">
  ...
  </div>
  <div class="mdl-card__media">
  ...
  </div>
  <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
  ...
  </div>
  <div class="mdl-card__actions">
  ...
  </div>
</div>
```
&nbsp;4. Add content to each "inner" div, again depending on its intended use, using standard HTML elements and, optionally, additional MDL classes.
```html
<div class="mdl-card">
  <div class="mdl-card__title">
    <h2 class="mdl-card__title-text">title Text Goes Here</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="mdl-card__media">
    <img src="photo.jpg" width="220" height="140" border="0" alt="" style="padding:20px;">
  </div>
  <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
    This text might describe the photo and provide further information, such as where and
    when it was taken.
  </div>
  <div class="mdl-card__actions">
    <a href="(URL or function)">Related Action</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

The card component is ready for use.

####Examples

A card (no shadow) with a title, image, text, and action.

```html
<div class="mdl-card">
  <div class="mdl-card__title">
     <h2 class="mdl-card__title-text">Auckland Sky Tower<br/>Auckland, New Zealand</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="mdl-card__media">
    <img src="skytower.jpg" width="173" height="157" border="0" alt=""
     style="padding:10px;">
  </div>
  <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
  The Sky Tower is an observation and telecommunications tower located in Auckland,
  New Zealand. It is 328 metres (1,076 ft) tall, making it the tallest man-made structure
  in the Southern Hemisphere.
  </div>
  <div class="mdl-card__actions">
     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Tower_%28Auckland%29">Wikipedia entry</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

Card (level-3 shadow) with an image, caption, and text:

```html
<div class="mdl-card mdl-shadow--4dp">
  <div class="mdl-card__media"><img src="skytower.jpg" width="173" height="157" border="0"
   alt="" style="padding:10px;">
  </div>
  <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">

  </div>
  <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
  The Sky Tower is an observation and telecommunications tower located in Auckland,
  New Zealand. It is 328 metres (1,076 ft) tall, making it the tallest man-made structure
  in the Southern Hemisphere.
  </div>
</div>
```
