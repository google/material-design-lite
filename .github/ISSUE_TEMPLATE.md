## Feature Requests / Breaking Changes in mdl-1.x

The MDL core team has actively begun work on the next major version of MDL, dubbed **MDL v2**. Because we are a small team that's hyper-focused on delivering the best Material Design Library possible for the web, _it is highly unlikely that we will be actively working on new features or making backwards-incompatible changes for MDL as it currently exists._

If there is a non-breaking feature you would like to see implemented in `mdl-1.x` and are willing to contribute, we'd be happy to offer assistance with you doing so. But we will not personally be actively working on said features.

While we are just getting started with our next version of MDL, you can see our current progress on [master](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/tree/master) as well as an overview of the direction we're headed in our [(WIP) developer guide](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/blob/master/docs/DEVELOPER.md) as well as our [initial POC branch](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/tree/experimental/v2-architecture-poc) for our new architecture.

If you're interested in information for a specific MDL v2 component, check out our [v2-component issues](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Av2-component) to see which v2 milestone it's associated with and feel free to subscribe to that issue for updates.
