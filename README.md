# Material Design Lite

> A library of [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) components in CSS, JS, and HTML
([MDL website](http://getmdl.io)).

Material Design Lite lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your static content websites. It doesn't rely on any JavaScript frameworks or libraries. Optimized for cross-device use, gracefully degrades in older browsers, and offers an experience that is accessible from the get-go.

## Quick start

Four quick start options are available:

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/archive/master.zip).
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/google/material-design-lite.git`.
- Install with [Bower](http://bower.io): `bower install material-design-lite`.
- Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com): `npm install material-design-lite`.

## Getting Started

### Download

Clone or
[download](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/archive/master.zip)
this repository, [build it](#development) and reference the following files in your project:

```html
<script src="dist/js/material.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/css/material.min.css">
```

You will want to include the entire package to ensure optional assets like images or fonts are correctly
included.

### npm

```
npm install --save material-design-lite
```

### bower

```
bower install --save material-design-lite
```

## Icons

Material Design Lite uses the official [Material Icons font](https://www.google.com/design/icons/). We recommend you include it using:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"
      rel="stylesheet">
```

You can check for other options on the [Developer's Guide](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web).

All of the demos and templates in this project use the preferred ligature syntax:

```html
<i class="material-icons">face</i>
```

If you need to support older browsers, take a look at the [Developer's Guide](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web) for
how to use codepoints instead, as well as the [list of supported codepoints](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/master/iconfont/codepoints).


## Development

The sources (JS, Sass) and demo files for all components can be found in the `src` directory. To get started
modifying them, first install the necessary dependencies, from the root of the project:

```
npm install && npm install -g gulp
```

Next, run the following one-liner to preview the components:

```
gulp serve
```

Any changes made to files inside the `src` directory will cause the page to reload. This page can also be loaded
up on physical devices thanks to BrowserSync.

To build a production version of the components, run:

```
gulp
```

This will clean the `dist` folder and rebuild the assets for serving.

## Templates

The `templates/` subdirectory contains a few exemplary usages of MDL. Templates have their own, quasi-separate
gulp pipeline and can be compiled with `gulp templates`. The templates use the vanilla MDL JS and
[themed](http://google.github.io/material-design-lite/customizer/customizer.html) CSS files. Extraneous
styles are kept in a separate CSS file. Use `gulp serve` to take a look at the templates:

* [Blog Template](http://www.getmdl.io/templates/blog)
* [Dashboard Template](http://www.getmdl.io/templates/dashboard)
* [Text Heavy Webpage Template](http://www.getmdl.io/templates/text-only)
* [Stand Alone Article Template](http://www.getmdl.io/templates/article)
* [Android.com MDL Skin Template](http://www.getmdl.io/templates/android-dot-com)

> Templates are not officially supported in IE9 and legacy browsers that do not pass the minimum-requirements defined in our [cutting-the-mustard test](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/blob/master/src/mdlComponentHandler.js#L262-L275).

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Material Design Lite is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/). Sometimes we screw up, but we'll adhere to those rules whenever possible.

## Feature requests

If you find MDL doesn't contain a particular component you think would be useful, please check the issue tracker in case work has already started on it. If not, you can request a [new component](https://github.com/Google/material-design-lite/issues/new?title=[Component%20Request]%20{Component}&body=Please%20include:%0A*%20Description%0A*%20Material%20Design%20Spec%20link%0A*%20Use%20Case%28s%29).

## Do you include any features that a framework comes with?

Material Design Lite is focused on delivering a vanilla CSS/JS/HTML library of components. We are not a framework. If you are building a single-page app and require features like two-way data-binding, templating, CSS scoping and so forth, we recommend trying out the excellent [Polymer](http://polymer-project.org) project.
