> An implementation of [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)
components in vanilla CSS, JS, and HTML.

Material Design Lite (MDL) lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your
static content websites. It doesn't rely on any JavaScript frameworks or
libraries. Optimized for cross-device use, gracefully degrades in older
browsers, and offers an experience that is accessible from the get-go.

## Want to contribute?

If you found a bug, have any questions or want to contribute. Follow our
[guidelines](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
and help improve the Material Design Lite. For more information visit our
[wiki](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/wiki).

If you are submitting a bug fix or a new component for the 1.x line, please send those into `mdl-1.x` currently.

The `master` branch is where we are working on 2.0.
It is currently **highly** experimental and no support building or using it will be provided.

## Use MDL on your site?

**This document is targeted at developers that will contribute to or compile
MDL. 
If you are looking to use MDL on your website or web app please head to
[getmdl.io](http://getmdl.io).The site contains code samples and customize features for components**

## Browser Support in v1

### Download / Clone

Clone the repo using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/material-design-lite.git
```

Alternatively you can [download](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/archive/master.zip)
this repository.

Windows users, if you have trouble compiling due to line endings then make sure
you configure git to checkout the repository with `lf` (unix) line endings. This
can be achieved by setting `core.eol`.

```bash
git config core.eol lf
git config core.autocrlf input
git rm --cached -r .
git reset --hard
```

> Remember, the master branch is considered unstable. Do not use this in
production. Use a tagged state of the repository, npm, or bower for stability!

## Feature requests

If you find MDL doesn't contain a particular component you think would be
useful, please check the issue tracker in case work has already started on it.
If not, you can request a [new component](https://github.com/Google/material-design-lite/issues/new?title=[Component%20Request]%20{Component}&body=Please%20include:%0A*%20Description%0A*%20Material%20Design%20Spec%20link%0A*%20Use%20Case%28s%29).
Please keep in mind that one of the goals of MDL is to adhere to the Material
Design specs and therefore some requests might not be within the scope of this
project.
