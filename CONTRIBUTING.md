*[Website](https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit/) related issues should be filed on the [Web Fundamentals](https://github.com/google/WebFundamentals/issues/new) issue tracker.*

Web Starter Kit is an open source project. It is licensed using the
[Apache Software License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).
We appreciate pull requests, here are our guidelines:

1. File a bug at https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/issues (if there
isn’t one already). If your patch is going to be large it might be a good idea
to get the discussion started early. We are happy to discuss it in a new issue beforehand.
1. Make sure that patches provide justification for why they should be merged. Web Starter Kit is an opinionated project and as such, patches which add support for alternative choices to those we prescribe are not guaranteed to land.
1. Due to legal reasons, all contributors must sign a contributor license
agreement, either for an
[individual](https://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html) or
[corporation](https://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html), before a
patch can be accepted.
1. We ask that you squash all the commits together before pushing.
