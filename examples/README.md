# MDL Framework Integration Examples

> NOTE: Angular2 example currently not functional. It will be updated before our alpha launch.

This directory contains examples which show how you can easily integrate MDL components into any
framework by using their foundations and providing adapters for them. The examples in this directory
show how you can wrap a checkbox component.

For more information on foundations and adapters, see our developer guide (_TK!!!_)
