# MDL Framework Integration Examples

This directory contains examples which show how you can easily integrate MDL components into any
framework by using their foundations and providing adapters for them. The examples in this directory
show how you can wrap a checkbox component.

We will _happily_ accept PRs showing how to wrap components within other frameworks as well! The
more the merrier :smile:.

For more information on foundations and adapters, see our developer guide (_coming soon_).
