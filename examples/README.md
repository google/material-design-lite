# NOTE: Not currently functional.

We've recently [changed our architecture]() such that these examples are outdated and probably don't
work. We will fix them up before our beta release, as things may still change until then.

Working framework examples for v2 can be found on our [POC branch](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/tree/experimental/v2-architecture-poc/examples).
