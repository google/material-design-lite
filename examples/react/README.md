# MDL Checkbox Example - React

This folder contains an example of using mdl-checkbox within React.

It is based off of [react-hot-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate)

## Setup

1. Run `npm install` within this folder
2. Run `npm start` to start the demo server
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the demo.

## Notes

The checkbox wrapper is implemented within `src/Checkbox.js`, which is annotated with comments. There are also simple wrapper components for both the checkbox wrapper classes and the checkbox label (both implemented as pure functions).
