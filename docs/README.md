# MDL v2 Docs

Welcome to our (very-much-still-in-progress) v2 documentation! As we develop MDL v2, we will be
adding and amending this documentation such that v2 is both easy to get up-and-running, as well as
thorough enough for advanced developers to understand why we made the decisions we did for the
project.

To jump right in and begin using the library, check out our [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.md)

If you're interested in a general overview of MDL v2, check out [developer.md](./developer.md). If
you want to take a deep dive through our architectural overview, jump right into
[architecture.md](./architecture.md).
