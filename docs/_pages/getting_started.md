##Introduction

The Material Design Lite (MDL) **button** component is an enhanced version of the standard HTML `<button>` element. A button consists of text and/or an image that clearly communicates what action will occur when the user clicks or touches it. The MDL button component provides various types of buttons, and allows you to add both display and click effects.
